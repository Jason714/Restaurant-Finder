# The Fine Diner

The Fine Diner (https://jason714.github.io/Restaurant-Finder/) is a search engine that is designed for users who want to locate upscale dining establishments. This app helps sort through the clutter of restaurants that most apps will return in searches and delivers only the top 10 rated restaurants in a given area. Not all areas are going to have restaurants that meet the search criteria of the app (searching a major metropolitan area is recommended for best results). The landing page gives a brief explantion of the apps functionality along with a carousel of some examples (Our favorites) of top rated restaurants from across the United States. Clicking the search button in the site header opens a modal for the user to enter the area they want to search. Once the area is entered and the user clicks search in the modal the about and our favorites sections are hidden and the results of the search along with a map that has pins for each restaurants location is displayed. The search results are displayed in a scrollable column on the left side of the page, each result has a brief description of the restaurant with a link to it's website as well as a link to reviews. Clicking on a pin on the map will pop up a small window that has a little information about the restaurant at that location with a link to the restaurants website.
